# CDK

[CDK Features](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/features/?refid=ce1f55b8-6da8-4aa2-af36-3f11e9a449ae)

Allows you to define your cloud resources using 'familiar programming languages'.

Programmable infrastructure as code.

'Constructs' cloud components that encode configuration, detail, boilerplate and glue logic. Adjustable and composable.

Provides CFN Resources for all base-level AWS CloudFormation resources.

AWS CloudFormation: easy way to create a collection of related AWS and third-party resources, and provision and manage them in an orderly and predictable fashion.

Because it creates required sub-resources with sensible defaults, you can write a small amount of code to create large Cloud Formation definitions, and reuse without copy+paste+modify.
